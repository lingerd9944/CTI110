        <p>Hello, I'm hoping this site can be a good place for people to come to learn a little psychology, keep up with their current knowledge, or even get inspired to learn more. 
            Right now, this site only contains some basic history and current events in psychology. But, It would be nice to eventually add to this by adding more links to existing pages, 
            some more resources for people to get into psychology, and possibly even a chat room function.  
        </p>
