        <h5>These illustrate some of the tragic misteps that researchers have taken in the past. This is by no means an exhaustive list.</h5>

                <td>Lacks experimental structure, famous from the 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v Topeka Board of Education</td>
                <td>Highly unethical due to the brutality 'prisoners' faced at the hands of the 'guards' with little to no oversight intervention by researchers</td>
                <td>Focuses only on boys, of a similar socioeconomic status, ethnic identity, religious backgroud, thus ungeneralisable</td>
